# Foodtopia

A responsive dynamic app which can be filtered for dietary requirements

## User story

AS a user when I go on the app, I expect to find a short intro with what the app is offering me (recipes based on dietary preferences and a randomly generated FUN FACT about foods, a navigation bar and a search bar) and tiles with different dietary needs.
On the navigation bar, I EXPECT to see the app logo and navigation links to “My Favorites”, “Home”, “Recipes”.

AFTER, I should be able to search recipes ideas based on the choices I “ticked” on the dropdown search bar. (e.g., Italian food, vegetarian, what’s on my fridge). At the bottom of the search bar, I EXPECT to see different tiles with dietary needs (e.g., vegan, keto, alcohol-free). WHEN I input a search on the Search bar, I SOULD be relocated to the menu page with related recipes to the search.

On the menu page, I EXPECT to see card-recipes (with background image of the food and title of the recipe).

WHEN I click on the card-recipe, I expect to be relocated to the specific recipe page. In that container I WANT to see the image of recipe on the side and one option button (add to Favorites) and FUN FACTS on the side. When I CLICK on “add to Favorites”, my recipe will be added to “My favorites”. When I hover over the search bar, my previous searches are displayed. When I CLICK on a previous search, I will be TAKEN to that recipe.

Here, I expect to see the ingredients displayed and the steps to prepare the food. I also EXPECT to see the number of calories/per portion, macronutrients percentages (protein, fat, and carbs), and vitamins percentage (vitamins B, vitamin C, vitamin A).

When I click on “My Favorites” tab on navbar, I EXPECT to be taken on a page where my favorite recipes are presented as a list of cards with recipe image and title. I should also have a button to go back to Search page.
