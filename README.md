## Description

A responsive dynamic app which will run in the browser. Foodtopia is easy to use application and user led database search engine for different types of recipes. The website requires direct input from the user, in order to display results relating to their specific search. The user can filter their search for different recipes by dietary options, types of cuisines and intolerances and allergies.

## User Story

AS a user when I GO on the app,

I expect to FIND a main page with a navigation bar on the top containing the project LOGO and three links, Recipes, Diet and My Fav.

ALSO a search bar with an Input Box, a Search Button and three filters. Diet, Intolerances and Cuisines.

I expect to FIND on the bottom of the page a footer.

When I CLICK on the Recipes link,

I should be REDIRECT to the recipes page, Where I expect to SEE a carousel on the top showing recipes that may interest the user, a filter button and card-recipes containing:

- a background image of the dish,
- the recipe title,
- the time and the portions,
- the nutritional info. ( )

When I CLICK on the card-recipe,

I EXPECT to be relocated to the specific recipe page,

Where I WANT to see:

- the recipe name,
- the image of the respective recipe,
- a box with the instructions of how to cook the recipe,
- one option button (add to Favorites),
- a card showing the time, the portions and the ingredients,
- box with the nutritional info. ( ),
- a carousel at the bottom with recipes that may interest the user.

When I CLICK on “add to Favorites”,

I EXPECT my recipe be added to “My favorites”.

When I CLICK on Diet,

I should SEE a scroll bar with the different dietary types ( )

When I CLICK on My Fav,

I EXPECT to be relocated to a page presenting all my favorites recipes cards,
When I HOVER over the search bar,

I EXPECT my previous searches been displayed.

When I CLICK on a previous search,

I should be TAKEN to that specific recipe.

Also, I should be able to SEARCH recipes ideas based on the choices I “ticked” on the dropdown search bar. (e.g., Italian food, vegetarian, gluten free)

When I INPUT something,

I should be RELOCATED to the menu page with related recipes to the specific search.
